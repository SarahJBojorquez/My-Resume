					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<p>
                        Over 15 years of experience working in HR and Talent Acquisition has given me a unique view of Talent Acquisition. Currently, I work as Centric Softwareâ€™s Talent Acquisition Partner, connecting great candidates with their perfect roles and analyzing current hiring and employment trends.  I partner directly with senior management on talent management strategy and execution.  I act as a recruiting consultant and business partner to provide advice and coaching throughout the recruitment process to fill career and professional roles according to highly technical job profiles for 200+ vacancies. 
                        </p>
                       
                        <p>
                        I love learning for the sake of learning and am always curious about new things.  I am a speed reader and enjoy nothing more than curling up with a book.  I truly believe that travel is the best way to broaden the mind, but reading is a very close second. </p>
